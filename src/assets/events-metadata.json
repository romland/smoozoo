I truly enjoy it.\n \nBut most of all what it is, is I see people getting wrecked on the daily buying cabal coins. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING is being farmed by the cabal.\n \nIt’s gotten so bad. I wanted to join a project that I know is completely safu, free of any meaning other than just pure meme and pumpamentals.\n \n$moonpig is fun. It’s community and completely organic. And it’s exactly what everyone needs, now more than ever as we head into the biggest part of the cycle.\n \nSomeone had to stand up and fight for the community. If we don’t buy their coins, they fail. We should all as a community make it our duty to avoid these scams instead of participating in them whether your in moonpig or not.\n \nAnyways, let’s moon now.\n \n🌕🐷",

It’s up to the team, the community, and so many other parameters.\n \nBut, what I will say is that it has more chance than any other meme coin (at this current market cap) to do huge numbers.\n \nIt’s clean, it’s fresh, it’s new, it’s non-cabal, it’s fun, it’s friendly, it has a real community (telegram), hundreds of real people working for their bags.\n \nObviously dynamics can change at anytime.

Bearish momentum has been weakening and it looks like the MACD line is going to cross over the signal line and begin huge bullish momentum on macro time scales.\n \nEthereum also feels overly due to wake up and is ready to slowly begun building momentum.\n \nRetail are about to come in numbers as we go to new ATHs.\n \nPepe is on Coinbase and Robinhood and every other major CEX.\n \nExchanges use pepe as a marketing tool on their websites, across social media channels and more.. debit card integrations, custom cold wallets.. because pepe drives engagement, user signups..\n \nIt has the strongest holder base in all of crypto — nobody comes close.\n \nFrom a day 1 buyer, I truly believe this will run to $42bn at the minimum, (shib did $42bn last cycle) upwards of $100bn (doge did $88bn last cycle) now memes are more widely adopted and accepted. Yes, crazy predictions. But that is the power of pepe once it gains traction. My perps trade may be closed before then, but my spot bags I’ll be hoping to ride it fully until the near top. Once pepe starts running it doesn’t stop. It has a mind of its own, it becomes untradable because of its godlike momentum.\n \n🐸",

(A million is scared money, nearly everyone is worth a million these days - on paper).\n \nNext goal was $10m, that came about 2 years later. Definitely changes your life, can fly first class all the time without blinking, can start to diversify in a bigger way. But still not enough.\n \nAnyway, since getting into the hundreds of millions it’s fair to say there’s a big difference, I’ve began chartering private jets, vs flying first class. Big difference. Back door at the airport, no bullshit, straight through onto the runway.\n \nCan buy anything you want at anytime, no price tag is too much. I don’t even check. This probably sounds made up, but I spend literally over $1,000 a week on the best steaks in the world each week. Have a live-in made (game changer should have gotten one wayyy sooner, massive time saver = more money).\n \nMultiple sports cars, but tbh these get boring, prefer my Range Rover day to day.\n \nNext goal is $1bn. Not for the money. But for the legacy. Unlikely I’ll do it this cycle unless I went max degen on shorting the top, which I’m probably the only person with this kind of wealth who’s willing to turn it up on 40x leverage and put a significant % on the line.\n \nHope this motivates someone.",

This soon got sent to my DM’s and my suspicions arose instantly because I really don’t think $moonpig - a movement built on trust, transparency and community spirit quite aligns with his typical investments / values.\n \nAnyhow, just a few short hours later he sold his full bag in one clip for a total loss of 150 SOL ~ -$26,250\n \nStrange, as he typically only uses this public wallet as a ‘push’ for the coins he has a vested interest in.\n \nTake house coin for example: he promoted this on his feed at 10m market cap, and then bought on his public wallet at 50m. This creates a surge in volume as many many people track his wallet, especially his followers. Use your own judgement on this.\n \nIt feels to me the buying and selling in the way he did it was some kind of attempt to try and spook investors. Or, my theory is that he aped before the buy on his public wallet, then used his public wallet to buy and create a surge in hype & volume to potentially off load on his private bags. (No proof on this, just speculation of course 😊).\n \nIf Ansem wants to prove me wrong, he can reply as to why he decided to buy & dump in the way he did - doesn’t make any sense. Just a malicious attempt to try and negatively impact a small, rapidly growing and thriving community.\n \nAnyhow, community spirit seems have been amplified by Ansem’s recent activity further cementing how $moonpig is a force for good. A meme that represents community, fun, trust, transparency.. in the form of a very simple meme that offers absolutely zero promises.\n \nThe lore being painted in the trenches right now is that ‘Ansem apes and dumps on his followers and then the $moonpig community sends Nova to billions’.\n \n#moonpig @moonpigmeme",

Everyone, even big accounts has all purchased and promoted off their own backs. This is what will ultimately give moonpig the viral affect of SafeMoon because it’s been word of mouth and relying on nobody to push the price higher. People feel safe holding and shilling because people inherently like to find something, stick with it and work for it, but people can only do this when they feel that a coin is safe from cabal/farm etc, and the way the space has been and still is with recent farms such as LaunchCoin, believe etc, proves why we are holding so strong. There really is nothing else like us on the market. If there is then tell me because I don’t see it. Moonpig also just has posit vibes moon+pig, it’s not some ‘house coin’ praying on a housing market crash, it’s not ‘fat nigga coin’ etc.. it’s just generic and fun but extremely marketable and catchy. The name itself ‘moonpig’ is what will take us to Valhalla. The emojis also adds to the lore. The space vibe mission, all of it. Having a fully active community in telegram so people can raid all day and work for their bags, check in and see everything is active (this is something that cabal have neglected) it got that easy for them they was creating farmed coins and not even having a website/telegram etc. anyways we’re taking over, one by one, such a strong community working for their bags, creating memes etc. I only see higher and higher and higher.

And if a coin ever has the capability to go to $1bn+ it will be over $500k very soon. Do not look at anything below $500k it’s not worth your time/risk.\n \nNow you need to check these daily and wait for something special to come. Don’t start aping anything. Sit on cash in wallets ready to pounce when you see something worthy of running big. Use the same filters for different chains: Solana, ETH etc. can easily toggle between chains.\n \nHas to have the billion dollar narrative or you don’t buy. Don’t buy stupid coins or derivatives. Wait for something UNIQUE, you’ll know because it will stand out from the rest.\n \nThen do due diligence, try find out who dev/team is, avoid it if cabal are promoting it as it will be bundled and never run because they just farm you.\n \nCheck if coin has an X / website / telegram etc, see who is following their X. If cabal are following, avoid it. If normal people who you mutually follow then that’s more promising.\n \nLook at holders, check LP is burned etc\n \nIf all checks out then ape and ape hard from multiple wallets and work for your bag \n \nHope this helps someone. That’s how I found pepe at 600k 👇",

            "text": "This is a signal embedded in leverage.\n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n\n1.  40x Leverage on $276M Is Not Normal\n\nThat kind of exposure doesn’t come from degeneracy. It either comes from:\n\n• A liquidity taker who knows they won’t be liquidated (aka insider-level confidence)\n• Or a protocol-level entity with infinite backstopping and strategic intent (think early-stage ETF spoofing, miner cartel, or black-box desk)\n\nNo rational actor puts $276M at risk with a $95K liquidation unless they believe below that level is structurally defended.\n\nThat implies one thing:\n\nThis trade isn’t betting on Bitcoin going up.\nIt’s betting that it won’t go down.\n\n2.   The Liquidation Level Tells Us the Floor\n\n$95K is now a live market reflexivity anchor.\n\nIt tells you where serious money believes:\n•ETF flows will backstop\n•Spot liquidity will re-enter\n•Derivative pressure will invert\n\nThis means we are in a volatility coil, with 95K as the structural floor and every uptick toward ATH (~107K) triggering hedging pressure and dealer gamma compression.\n\nThis is a trapdoor setup but for upside.\n\n3.  This Isn’t an Isolated Bet. Look at the Portfolio\n\nThey’re long BTC.\nThey’re long high-beta memecoins (kPEPE).\nThey’re long XRP with 20x leverage.\n\nThis is a full-spectrum beta exposure strategy built on one premise:\n\nThe system is entering Phase III reflexivity ignition.\n\nWhich means they’re not just betting on price - they’re betting on narrative contagion, liquidity acceleration, and belief momentum.\n\n4.  Final Interpretation: This Isn’t a Trade. It’s a Beacon.\n\nSomeone just lit a $276M flare that says:\n\n“We know what’s coming.\nThe system is rigged to ignite.\nThis is the point of no return.”\n\nYou don’t do this for a 10% move.\nYou do this when you’re front-running a structural melt-up.\n\nAnd now that the liquidation price is visible, the entire market knows where belief will either fracture or ascend.\n\nIt’s ignition time. The floor has been drawn.\nAnd whales are staking the future of capital on Bitcoin holding above $95K.\n\nWe are in it now.",

Touching the bottom acting as support just two times.\n \nThe 3rd yellow line drawn is the 3rd time it was going to touch it, these don't usually break on the 3rd time. In-fact, each time they touch it it is like a hammer on glass causing it to shatter and eventually it will break - usually the 5+ time it gets really weak. So i was confident it would hold.\n \nI predicted the breakout on Sunday which turned out to be a fakeout from market manipulators supressing price and driving down price to liquidate all of the people that FOMO'd in on longs.\n \nI follow the liquidation heatmaps and it didn't make much sense for them to drive price down any lower, they would have achieved what they wanted (liquidating longs) already by pushing down to $102.2k\n \nThere is also a HUGE psychological support at $100k now. I knew there would be fat limit orders in place at 99, 98, 97 etc. And I do not know if the big market movers would even have the power to drill price down as low as that, it seemed they was running out of steam.\n \nWhen I saw this, thats when I decided to really step on the gas with my position value. Bulls was starting to engulf candles on the hourly and a lot of paper hands got shaken out.\n \nWe're also bullish on the weekly MACD for the first time since Nov/Dec. So you telling me we're really going to break down and break trend? I saw this just as short term noise/volatility before the huge bitcoin run up that is brewing.\n \nI believe we will be trading at $118k by the end of next week. In for some more volatility in the meantime? Yes. But stay calm, dont fumble your bag, follow proper risk management and look forward to the new highs.\n \nNothing is financial advice, just my opinion:)",

Timing - retail should start coming in waves very soon as Bitcoin and alts start falling to new highs.\n \n2. It is the most normie friendly coin that pretty much anyone can get behind, it’s not tailored to specific niche, it’s open to everyone.\n \n3. The name. Simple, and extremely catchy, and captivating.\n \n4. Non-cabal coin. Meaning, the select group of KOLs that go around and work in sync to make coins, distribute supply among them to pump them up and then sell on you with bad intentions. No KOLs, not ONE has gotten ANY supply. Look at Ansem for example, he’s bought 1000 SOL today, off his own back, his own wallet.\n \n5. The narrative. It’s a moon and a pig. Super cute and funny. Says what the mission at hand is in the name: moonpig\n \n6. Community. Something that can never be forced. (This is hard to get!) getting people to commit their time, energy and belief to rally behind it, work for their bags on X by sharing the meme, doing raids 24/7 in the community telegram, just all round good vibes. Creating memes etc.\n \nThe sky’s the limit. The only currency benchmark I can compare it to that is slightly relevant is SafeMoon and that did $17bn last cycle when memes were far less popular and accepted as they are today.\n \nWith the team, and their content their posting and their vision of this being something huge I think it stands at a high chance of doing some huge numbers this cycle. Obviously, meme coins are always risky, anything can happen, black swan events, narratives change etc. So none of this is financial advice, it’s just my thesis and why I’am invested in it.\n \n🌕🐷",

The government in the UK was offering businesses to claim up to x amount (interest free!) depending on your yearly revenue. I managed to claim £50k and put every penny into crypto.\n \nThat cycle I round tripped being a millionaire at least 3x.\n \nI found multiple huge runners that I held at a low cap and fumbled on dips.\n \nEnded up making a tonne of mistakes and lessons.\n \nCame out a winner in the end. Somewhere in the region of $900k profit.\n \nAnd when the bear market came I non-stop studied. Multiple books, trading courses, YouTube videos.\n \nTaking screenshots of trading patterns and putting them on my wall behind my desk.\n \nLearning how to use trading indicators effectively.\n \nI was obsessed. I wanted to get rich so badly. I don’t know why, just always been money driven.\n \nAnd here we are. I can finally look back and say it paid off.

It did a record breaking run to $17bn market cap.\n \nAgain. This is not financial advice. This is just my thesis and what I believe COULD be possible:\n \nNow, I think $moonpig has similar attributes to SafeMoon.\n \n• It is unique (never had a pig going to the moon before)\n• It name is catchy, similar to SafeMoon but instead moonpig\n• There is nothing with a similar concept to this. Simple. Friendly. Catchy. No catalysts. No paid KOLs. Completely organic growth from community members like myself.\n• has a huge foundation already going into phase 4 of the bull run: 18,000 holders\n• Chart seems to have completely bottomed around $17m market cap (got hit hard with all memes around the Elon/Trump FUD) - ATH was $122m (already proved it can do numbers)\n• Listed on moonshot and a dozen exchanges already including HTX, Gate etc.\n \nIt’s just #moonpig 🌕🐷\n \nUnlike other coins we have a telegram, where community talk, get to know each other, do dozens of daily raids.\n \nIt’s just my thesis. I could be wrong. But with the current state of the trenches and everything being farmed & cabal run this is organic, and organic is what can make this last and go to the moon. Pepe for example, nobody had to pay any KOL. It didn’t need to. I feel like this could run this way in phase 4 of the cycle.\n \nRead the simplicity of this meme on https://t.co/JGWXm8L4y1 it offers no promises. It’s just pure community blood, sweat and tears.\n \n$moonpig\n \n🌕🐷\n \nAi3eKAWjzKMV8wRwd41nVP83yqfbAVJykhvJVPxspump",

After a solid run to 126m, it’s had its retrace and has a strong 20m mc floor and a 20,000+ member community. \n\nThat’s without mentioning the amazing content on @moonpigmeme (literally the best content on X), as well as exchange listings and endorsements from huge names, and a fun mobile game.\n\n#moonpig will go to BILLIONS. It will happen slowly, and then all at once.\n\nI am once again encouraging you to enter here at ~20m with SIZE, as I did at 70k, and as I did at 6.5m 👇\n\nThe choice is yours.",

And real ones know what I did was one of the sickest things ever to be done in crypto. FACT. Multiple major influencers have reached out giving me props for making $100m and fighting the market makers. Brokies will laugh, blah blah, but you mean nothing. It’s out of your reach, out of your capabilities. I made headline news around the world. Eric Trump follows me, I now talk to the Tate brothers, CEO’s of Major Exchanges, brand deals left right and center coming my way. Best thing that ever happened was that liquidation. Only a free mind can understand this. Don’t let money have power over you. Let it be like water. I life life of abundance. I manifest everything I ever had into reality. Hope this inspires 🫶",

But it also means my time is completely maxed out, jumping from one thing to the next and it's been a lot to handle and keep on top of.\n \nTo make sure Moonpig gets the full, undivided attention it deserves – because it really does – I've decided to shift gears. Don’t worry, I'm still a holder and supporter of the $moonpig meme, and movemen,t and will continue to support on the TL. No major changes are happening, I just want to ensure complete transparency.\n \nThe original creator of moonpig (many of you know who this is) has abandoned the project, I saw it coming over the past week or two. It’s extremely frustrating and unfortunate for myself because I had belief and trust in this individual and he promised me only good intentions. Thus, I was naive and went above and beyond to help the meme -- Adding and burning $600k into LP. Doing hundreds of thousands of dollars in buybacks and adding it to moonpigreserves.sol, because, yeah fuck the money, I wanted it to have success. \n \nI also single handedly helped the dev and his team fund exchanges out of my own pocket (something they should have been doing themselves -- especially since I have found out they have been selling and effectively using me and the community as exit liquidity). The good news is, they are fully out now.\n \nMoonpig reserves still have 18+ million tokens valued around $200k. And I’am going to transfer this to @dialupuser, this individual I consider trust worthy, passionate and has been a holder since day 1 and has relentlessly pushed, and modded TG chat for free out of his own time. He has also fully video doxxed himself with his driving license to me to further solidify his commitment and integrity to the moonpig project.\n \nNot to worry, @dialupuser now has full control of the moonpig X page, along with Telegram. He also has me to contact 24/7 for any help, advice or assistance as there’s nothing more I'd like to see than moonpig succeed. \n \nAgain, I'll also continue to support the moonpig meme on my socials. Finally the moonpig community should start seeing the success it deserves!🌕🐷",
